- keto requirements
  -  carb max is 20 grams

  - but I believe certain amount of carb is necessary for a beginner like me
  - so maybe I will switch to grilled chicken later

    - cause even a little insulin will provent you from burning fat
    - sugar triggers insulin, carbs should be avoided expect fibers
    - fat does not trigger insulin
