- keto requirements
  -  carb max is 20 grams
- fried chicken
  - fried chicken is not keto friendly as grilled chicken since it's contain flour
  - but I believe certain amount of carb is necessary for a beginner like me
  - so maybe I will switch to grilled chicken later
- avoid fat for supper, reason: 20220614
