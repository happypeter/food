- keto requirements
  -  carb max is 20 grams
- fried chicken
  - fried chicken is not keto friendly as grilled chicken since it's contain flour
  - but I believe certain amount of carb is necessary for a beginner like me
  - so maybe I will switch to grilled chicken later
- avoid fat for supper, reason: 20220614
- avoid high card meal, other than marathon preperation.
- why keto?
  - if you want to lose weight, you will love zero-insulin
    - cause even a little insulin will provent you from burning fat
    - sugar triggers insulin, carbs should be avoided expect fibers
    - fat does not trigger insulin
