Yesterday's chicken meal contained more than half of carb/sugar in the condiment and tomatoes, too much for the later 10km walk consumption. Last supper I had a bit meat and plant oil, now much, but enough to slow down the digest, so I could not poop everything out this morning. The above two reasons account for this mornings 0.5kg weight rise I believe.
